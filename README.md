# autopi-core

The software that runs on the autopi dongle.

## Getting Started

We are working on a getting started guide that will show how to get a virtual saltstack master server up and running, along with autopi core running on either a virtual salt minion, or an actual device.

For now, the focus of this repository is to give people an idea about what is going on on the device, what commands are available, and how they work.

### Prerequisites

The main requirement is saltstack, as this is the platform on which this reposity is built.

## Built With

* [Salt-Stack](http://www.saltstack.com) - Server provisioning system

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions, in any form, be it comments, issues, changes to the code, etc.

One rule: be nice :)
